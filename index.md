title: "Welcome to My Blog"

This is my first post on my new blog.
I'm currently physics major at university in South Korea. One reason I made here was making an archive of mine(and the other is just for studying, recording, and surfing). My native language is Korean so I'm planning to translate some of my essays from my private blog to here. 

Main interests: 

1. Physics, mathematical logic, Art theory: home base.
Additional tags
- Classical Mechanics [CM]
- Electrodynamics [ED]
- Relativity [R]
- Quantum Mechanics [QM]
- Thermal and Statistical Physics [TSP]
- Quantum Field Theory [QFT]
- Solid State Physics [SP]
- Mathematical Physics [MP]
- Computational Physics [CP]

2. Philosophy, language: second base

3. Tactics, music theory, riddle: some simple curiosities

4. Rubik's cube, violin, SF, spooky tales, other play: experimental mind.
