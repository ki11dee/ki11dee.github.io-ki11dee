# Compactness and Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem

## Compactness Theorem
  From the Model Existence Lemma,  
  $\Gamma$ has a model $\Leftrightarrow$ each finite subset $\Delta$ of $\Gamma$ has a model.

## Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem
   a\) Let $\Gamma$ be a satisfiable set of formulas in a countable language of cardinality $\lambda$. Then $\Gamma$ is satisfiable in some countable structure of size $\leq \lambda$.
   b\) Let $\Sigma$ be a set of sentences in a countable language of cardinality $\lambda$. If $\Sigma$ has any model, then it has a countable model of cardinality $\leq \lambda$.

This is a fundamental theorem in model theory along with the completeness and compactness theorems. Define $\mathfrak{A}$ is finite iff $\|\mathfrak{A}\|$ is finite, and $\mathcal{L}$ is finite iff the set of symbols is finite.

## Upward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem
  Let $\Gamma$ be satisfied in $\mathcal{L}$ where $ \text{card}(\mathcal{L}) = \lambda$ and in an infinite structure. Then $\Gamma$ is satisfied in $\mathfrak{A}$ of which cardinality is $\kappa \geq \lambda$ for every $\kappa$.

## Downward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem

## Skolem Paradox
  Let $A_{ST}$ be a set of axioms for set theory in which those axioms are consistent, so they have some model. By the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem, the axioms have a countable model $\mathfrak{S}$, which is also a model of all the sentences logically implied by $A_{ST}$. In the structure $\mathfrak{S}$, there is no point that satisfies the formal definition of being a one-to-one map of the natural numbers onto the universe. Outside $\mathfrak{S}$, this does not exclude the possibility of there being some genuine function providing such a one-to-one correspondence.

## Theories

## Łos-Vaught Test
  Let $T$ be a theory in a countable language. Assume that $T$ has no finite models.
  
  a\) If $T$ is $\aleph_0$-categorical, then $T$ is complete.
  
  b\) If $T$ is $\kappa$-categorical for some infinite cardinal $\kappa$, then $T$ is complete.
