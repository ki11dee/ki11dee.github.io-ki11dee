## Overview of this Category

![Hi](/assets/img/img.jpg)

Why do I draw things? Actually I don't know. I just like to since I was a kid. This category is for uploading my arts-illustrations, comics, and doodles.

Originally the BP series began as a realistic comic set in the 20th century, but it faced many limitations in its depiction, and most importantly, it struggled with clear genre classification. After some deliberation I decided to abandon trying to fit it into a specific genre and instead create a graphic novel simply titled **BP**. 

I've been working on scientific comics for a while(like xkvd or someone like that), but even that became exhausting so I substituted it with text. I made a prototype-style comic again recently and it seems like this version will be the final one. Compared to earlier versions, the characters are now much more abstract and most realistic details have been intentionally omitted. Information like nationality, birthplace and year, special interestsâ€”all these details have been excluded. This approach is necessary to maintain the core essence of the comic!

For now I'll roughly upload some versions of the explanation. There may eventually be a translated version of the comic available if the series develops further, I guess.
