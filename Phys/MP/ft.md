# Fourier Transforms

## 0. Sturm-Liouville Theory

Our matters of interest are:

(1) The conditions under which an ODE can be written as an eigenvalue equation with a self-adjoint (hermitian) operator.  
(2) Methods for solving ODEs subject to boundary conditions.  
(3) Properties of the solutions in (2).

The general eigenproblem characteristics of second-order differential equations are referred to as **Sturm-Liouville theory**, where the Hermitian operator $\mathcal{L}$ is expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}(x) &= \frac{d}{dx}\left(p(x)\frac{d}{dx} \right)+(\lambda w(x)-q(x)) \\
\mathcal{L}y &= \lambda y
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $p(x), q(x), w(x)$ are given functions, and $p(x) > 0$, $w(x) > 0$. $\lambda$ is a real discrete eigenvalue, and $y(x)$ is the eigenfunction, which must satisfy specific boundary conditions on the domain $[a,b]$:

1. **Dirichlet boundary conditions**: $y(a)$ and $y(b)$ are fixed to given values.
2. **Neumann boundary conditions**: The boundary terms vanish at the boundaries (e.g., $y'(a) + \alpha y(a) = 0$, $y'(b) + \beta y(b) = 0$).

Eigenfunctions in a Sturm-Liouville problem can be normalized by an appropriate constant, and eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues, $y_n(x)$ and $y_m(x)$, are orthogonal with respect to the weight function $w(x)$: $\int_a^b y_n(x)y_m(x)w(x)dx=0 \quad (\lambda_n \neq \lambda_m)$.

### Model of a Vibrating String

The motion of a vibrating string is described by the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2}=c^2\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}, \quad c=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
$$

Using separation of variables, $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$, the equation splits into two ODEs:

- $\frac{d^2T(t)}{dt^2} + \omega^2T(t) = 0$ (temporal equation)
- $\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} + \lambda X(x) = 0, \quad \lambda = \frac{\omega^2}{c^2}$ (spatial equation, eigenvalue problem)

If the string is fixed at both ends, the boundary conditions are $u(0,t) = u(L,t) = 0$. Interpreted as a Sturm-Liouville problem, $X(0) = X(L) = 0$. This determines the normal modes and eigenfrequencies of the string. Solving the spatial equation yields eigenvalues $\lambda_n = \left(\frac{n\pi}{L}\right)^2, \quad n=1,2,3,\dots$, with corresponding eigenfrequencies $\omega_n = c\sqrt{\lambda_n} = \frac{n\pi c}{L}$. The eigenfunctions (standing waves) are $X_n(x) = \sin{\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L} \right)}$. Eigenfunctions corresponding to different modes are orthogonal: $\int_0^L X_m(x)X_n(x)dx = 0 \quad (m \neq n)$.

From a physical perspective, the string forms standing wave patterns at specific eigenfrequencies, which depend on the string length $L$, tension $T$, and mass density $\mu$. At specific nodes, the displacement is always zero.

## 1. Fourier Series

The **Fourier series** is defined as a representation of a function or signal as a series of sines and cosines:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left[a_n\cos{nx} + b_n\sin{nx}\right] \\
a_n &= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f(s)\cos{ns}ds, \quad n=0,1,2,\dots \\
b_n &= \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f(s)\sin{ns}ds, \quad n=0,1,2,\dots
\end{aligned}
$$

From the form of the Fourier series, the imposed conditions are that $f(x)$ must have only a finite number of finite discontinuities and only a finite number of extreme values (maxima and minima) in $[0, 2\pi]$ (**Dirichlet conditions**). Such functions are called **piecewise regular**.

We can rewrite the equation as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_ne^{inx}, \\
c_n &= \frac{1}{2}(a_n-ib_n), \quad c_{-n}=\frac{1}{2}(a_n+ib_n), \quad n>0, \quad c_0 = \frac{1}{2}a_0
\end{aligned}
$$

Typically, $f(x)$ is a periodic continuous function, decomposed into frequency components via the Fourier series.

The Sturm-Liouville theory forms an orthogonal basis in function space. Thus, any function $f(x)$ can be represented similarly to a Fourier series using the eigenfunctions $y_n(x)$ of a Sturm-Liouville problem:

$$
f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty c_ny_n(x), \quad \text{where} \quad c_n=\frac{\int_a^b f(x)y_n(x)w(x)dx}{\int_a^b y_n(x)^2w(x)dx}
$$

For instance, in the vibration of a string, the solution $u(x,t)$ is expressed as a linear combination of eigenfunctions $X_n(x)$:

$$
u(x,t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left[ A_n\cos{\omega_nt}+B_n\sin{\omega_nt}\right]X_n(x)
$$

Here, $A_n$ and $B_n$ are Fourier coefficients.


## 2. (Continuous) Fourier Transform

The eigenvalue problems described above generate discrete eigenvalues under finite boundary conditions, which can be represented by Fourier series. However, when a string is infinitely long or boundary conditions are absent, the solution to the wave equation has a continuous frequency spectrum. In such cases, the **Fourier transform** is used.  
The FT is an *analysis* process, decomposing a complex-valued function $f(x)$ defined in time/space domain  into its constituent frequencies function defined in k-space codomain. It is a linear map of a continuous input function ($\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$) to continuous output function ($\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$). The inverse process is *synthesis*. With an analogy, the Fourier series actually is the synthesis formula which maps a continuous domain (real numbers) to discrete frequency components (integer indices).

$$
\begin{aligned}
c_n = \frac{1}{P}\int_{-P/2}^{P/2}f(x)e^{-i2\pi \frac{n}{P}x}dx \quad &\text{: analysis formula} \\ 
f(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_ne^{i2\pi \frac{n}{P}x}, \quad x \in [-P/2,P/2] \quad &\text{: synthesis formula}
\end{aligned}
$$

$P \rightarrow \infty$, the FT is typically defined as:

$$
\hat{f}(\omega) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)e^{i\omega t}dt
$$

For example, the wave equation describing the vibration of an infinitely long string is:

$$
u(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat{u}(k,0)e^{i(kx-\omega t)}dk
$$

Here, $\hat{u}(k,0)$ is the Fourier transform of the initial condition $u(x,0)$, and $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wavenumber, satisfying the relation $\omega = c\|k\|$. The Fourier transform converts oscillations occurring in space and time into the frequency domain, allowing analysis of each component.

In the large-$n$ limit, the delta function $\delta_n(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-n}^n e^{i\omega t}d\omega$ is especially useful in Fourier analysis and helps derive results for Fourier integrals:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-i\omega x}d\omega \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)e^{i\omega t}dt
$$

### Inverse Fourier Transform

The inverse Fourier transform is given by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{f}(\omega) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)e^{i\omega t}dt, \\
f(t) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat{f}(\omega)e^{-i\omega t}d\omega
\end{aligned}
$$

### Transforms in 3D Space

In three-dimensional space, the Fourier transform and its inverse are expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \int f(\mathbf{r})e^{i\mathbf{k \cdot r}}d^3r, \\
f(\mathbf{r}) &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \int \hat{f}(\mathbf{k})e^{-i\mathbf{k \cdot r}}d^3k
\end{aligned}
$$

### Properties of Fourier Transform

Some key properties of the Fourier transform are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left[f(\mathbf{r-R})\right]^T(\mathbf{k}) = e^{i\mathbf{k \cdot R}}\hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) \quad &\text{: translation}, \\
\left[f(\alpha \mathbf{r})\right]^T(\mathbf{k}) = \frac{1}{\alpha^3}\hat{f}(\alpha^{-1}\mathbf{k}) \quad &\text{: change of scale}, \\
\left[f(-\mathbf{r})\right]^T(\mathbf{k}) = \hat{f}(-\mathbf{k}) \quad &\text{: sign change}, \\
\left[f^*(-\mathbf{r})\right]^T(\mathbf{k}) = \hat{f}^*(\mathbf{k}) \quad &\text{: complex conjugation}, \\
\left[\nabla f(\mathbf{r})\right]^T(\mathbf{k}) = -i\mathbf{k}\hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) \quad &\text{: gradient}, \\
\left[\nabla^2 f(\mathbf{r})\right]^T(\mathbf{k}) = -k^2\hat{f}(\mathbf{k}) \quad &\text{: Laplacian}
\end{aligned}
$$

FT may be defined in some cases for non-integrable functions. $f$ need not be integrable. For example, the FT of the rectangular function is the [sinc function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_function), which is not [Lebesgue integrable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure). 

It is not generally possible to write the IFT as a Lebesque integral, but when both $f$ and $\hat{f}$ are integrable, the inverse equality holds for almost every $x$, so the FT is injective on [$L^1(\mathbf{R})$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space).

## 3. Fourier Convolution Theorem

The operation of combining two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to produce a new function is called [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution), defined as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
h(x)=(f*g)(x) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(y)f(x-y)dy, \\
(f*g)(\mathbf{r}) &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(\mathbf{r'})f(\mathbf{r-r'})d^3r' \quad \text{(in 3D)}
\end{aligned}
$$

### [Cross-Correlation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation)

$$
h(x)=(f \star g)(x)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \overline{f(y)}g(x+y)dy
$$

### [Parseval Relation (Rayleighâ€™s Energy Theorem)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parseval%27s_theorem)

Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be integrable, and let $\hat{f}(\omega)$ and $\hat{g}(\omega)$ be their FT. If $f, g$ are square-integrable, then

$$
<f,g>_{L^2}=\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\overline{g(x)}dx=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat{f}(\omega)\overline{\hat{g}(\omega)}d\omega
$$

### [Plancherel Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plancherel_theorem)

$$
||f||^2_{L^2}=\int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2dx=\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\hat{f}(\omega)|^2d\omega
$$

## 4. Signal-Processing Applications

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
f(t) &=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty F(\omega)e^{i\omega t}d\omega \\ 
F(\omega) &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t)e^{-i\omega t}dt

\end{aligned}
$$

Here $f(t)$ is a resolution of the pulse into its angular frequency components and $F(\omega)$ a synthesis of the pulse from its components.  
Now assuming a linear response (but for your information, there are other requirements than linearity that must be satisfied by the response function on physical grounds: reality and causality), let us consider a servomechanism for an input of $f_\omega(t)=F(\omega)e^{i\omega t}$ and output of $g_\omega(t)=\phi(\omega)f_\omega(t)$, where $\phi_\omega(t)$ is called a **transfer function**.

## 5. [Discrete Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform)

In real world, we use digital computers with numerically determined FTs, which consist of values given at a *discrete* set of points. Integrations are therefore converted into  *finite* summations, and the number of the points can be *finite* or *infinite*. 
The Fourier series deals with periodic continuous functions and consists of infinite frequency components. The **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**, on the other hand, transforms *finite discrete* sampled data into its *finite discrete* frequency components. For a data length of $N$, only $N$ frequency components are calculated, making it widely used in digital signal processing.

## 6. [Laplace Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform#Fourier_transform)

The Laplace Transformation is a linear map of a continuous input function ($[0,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ or $[0,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$) to a continuous output function ($\mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$). 

It is defined as:

$$
F(s) = \mathcal{L}[f(t)]= \int_0^\infty f(t)e^{-st}dt \quad \text{where} \quad s = \sigma + i\omega
$$

The Fourier transform is a special case of the Laplace transform with $\sigma = 0$. The LT is a mathematical technique used for solving differential equations which transform them into algebraic equations.
