# Classical Mechanics

![Map of CM](/assets/img/mapcm.png)

This category basically includes college and graduate level CM and Classical field theory. There are many references but I prefer *Classical mechanics* by Morin, same titie by Goldstein, *Mechanics* and *Classical Theory of Fields* by Landau, *Analytical Mechanics* by Fowles, *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* by Marion, and several lecture notes.

- [Dynamics and Relativity]
- [Lagrangian Formulation]
- [The Motion of Rigid Bodies]
- [The Hamiltoniam Formulation]
- [KAM Theory]
