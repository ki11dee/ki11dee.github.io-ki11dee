# Solid State Physics

Currently I'm in one of the professors' lab in my university, who is major in strongly correlated system and electron structure calculation. If there's a chance there might be more files which I'm researching for these days to the extent of my knowledge and available time uploaded later. Most of the notes would be for my study.

Here are the lists in Solid State Physics tag:

- [Quantum Hall Effect]
- [Topological Insulators]
- [Band Theory and Electronic Properties of Solids]
