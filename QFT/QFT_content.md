# Classical Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory

![Map of CM](/assets/img/mapcm.png)

This category basically includes college level and graduate level CM and field theory. There are many references but I prefer *Classical mechanics* by Morin, same titie by Goldstein, *Mechanics* and *Classical Theory of Fields* by Landau, *Analytical Mechanics* by Fowles, *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* by Marion, and several lecture notes.

- [Dynamics and Relativity]
- [Lagrangian Formulation]
- [The Motion of Rigid Bodies]
- [The Hamiltoniam Formulation]

There's couple of good lecture notes by David Tong(Thank you sir <3); Lecture notes on [QFT](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html), so check it out. Also QFT is known to be highly important in several fields especially theoretical Physics, not only HEP-TH but also including solid state physics and statistical physics. But presently I'm planning to major in condensed matter physics after attending graduate school, so I would just briefly study these topics.
