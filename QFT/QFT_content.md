# Quantum Field Theory

There's couple of good lecture notes by David Tong(Thank you sir <3); Lecture notes on [QFT](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html), so check it out. Also QFT is known to be highly important in several fields especially theoretical Physics, not only HEP-TH but also including solid state physics and statistical physics. But presently I'm planning to major in condensed matter physics after attending graduate school, so I would just briefly study these topics.
